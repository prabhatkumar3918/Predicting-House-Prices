Title: Predicting House Prices: A Comprehensive Analysis

Introduction:
This project focuses on predicting house prices using a comprehensive analysis of various features. The dataset used contains information about different aspects of residential properties, including their characteristics and selling prices. The aim is to develop a predictive model that can accurately estimate house prices based on these features.

Data Exploration:
The project begins with importing the necessary libraries, including pandas, numpy, seaborn, and matplotlib, for data manipulation, visualization, and analysis. The dataset is loaded using pandas, and its shape and column information are examined. Initial exploratory data analysis is performed to gain insights into the data. Key statistics, such as mean, standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis, are calculated for the target variable, 'SalePrice,' and visualized using distribution plots.

Feature Analysis:
To understand the relationship between individual features and the target variable, scatter plots and box plots are generated for select variables such as 'GrLivArea,' 'TotalBsmtSF,' 'OverallQual,' and 'YearBuilt.' Additionally, a correlation matrix is created using the Pearson correlation coefficient to identify the variables most strongly correlated with 'SalePrice.' The top variables are selected based on their correlation values, and a heatmap is plotted to visualize the correlations between them.

Outlier Detection:
Outliers can significantly impact the accuracy of predictive models. To identify and handle outliers, a method based on Mahalanobis distance is implemented for 'GrLivArea' and 'TotalBsmtSF.' The Mahalanobis distances for each data point are calculated, and points with distances above a threshold are considered outliers and subsequently removed from the dataset.

Data Preprocessing:
To prepare the data for modeling, certain preprocessing steps are undertaken. Firstly, the 'Id' column, which does not provide any useful information, is dropped. Next, the distribution of the target variable, 'SalePrice,' is examined and found to be right-skewed. To address this, a logarithmic transformation (log1p) is applied to 'SalePrice' to achieve a more normal distribution. The transformed distribution is visualized using distribution plots and a Q-Q plot.

Feature Engineering:
To enhance the predictive power of the model, feature engineering techniques are employed. A new feature, 'TotalSF,' is created by summing the areas of the basement, first floor, and second floor. This total square footage is hypothesized to have a significant impact on house prices.

Handling Skewed Features:
Skewed numerical features can adversely affect model performance. Therefore, a check for skewness is conducted on all numerical features. Features with skewness above a threshold of 0.75 are identified and transformed using the Box-Cox transformation.

Encoding Categorical Features:
Categorical features are converted into numerical representations using one-hot encoding. This process creates binary columns for each category, allowing the model to effectively interpret categorical information.

Model Selection and Evaluation:
The project utilizes the LazyRegressor library to evaluate a range of regression models for predicting house prices. The models are trained on the training data and evaluated using the test data. The root mean squared error (RMSE) is used as the performance metric for model comparison. The best-performing models are identified and presented.

Regularization Techniques:
Two popular regularization techniques, Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression, are implemented to improve model performance and prevent overfitting. Cross-validation is employed to select the optimal regularization hyperparameters. The RMSE values for different alpha values are calculated and plotted to visualize the effect of regularization on model performance.

Conclusion:
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of house prices prediction. By exploring the dataset, identifying key features, handling outliers, preprocessing data, engineering new features, and selecting appropriate models, a robust predictive model is developed. The results of this project can be utilized in the real estate industry to estimate house prices accurately and guide buyers, sellers, and investors in making informed decisions.
